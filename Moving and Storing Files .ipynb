    "# Moving Files from Staging to Storage\n",
    "By Rachel Swallow \n",
    "\n",
    "To move a file in Python, we will need to import the os and shutil modules that provide us the ability to copy, move, and remove files in Python. Both of these modules provide methods to do so, although in many cases the shutil module has more convenient methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to a created folder called 'Stagging' then a check with the API needs to occur then if it meets that condition it is moved to a 'Storage' folder (which will be later changed to the relevent backend solution). "

    "* I need to implement more error checks (maybe a later sprint goal)\n",
    "* The naming conventioin of the files needs to change to a standerdized thing. eg: Author then title\n",
    "* File download directory needs to be specified (preferably directly into staging).\n",

    "* I probably have to write a docker image for this hey ?\n",
